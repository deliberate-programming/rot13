## Analysis
### Log
#### Commit 8db7a8f
Created a solution for a console applicationn w/o much thinking. Seemed make the task more tangible.

#### 3f2ae9f, a7ab7f4
Started drawing pretty late. First tried to wrap my head around the problem by writing something. But it then felt more natural and easier to quickly draw "the situation".

#### c8e1d59
I decided to "not play dumb". The exercise is not about "re-inventing" ROT13, but "to get the job done", i.e. the whole program to run. Hence I used Wikipedia to tell me how ROT13 can be most easily: with a map.

#### 8a842ec
Even though it's easy to do I put an example of encrypting a text and then decrypting the encrypted text in the analysis. Just to be sure I understood the algorithm correctly.

First I though encryption meant mapping Input to Output, and decryption meant mapping Output to Input. But for both en/decryption it's the same: Input -> Output.

#### fbde3b5
Non-map characters are not en/decrypted. Good to know. But it made me wonder about the value of this kind of encryption.

But I expect this fact to make it easier to process file content by just sucking in all text and doing a character-by-character mapping.

#### 8b8ca90, bdff37f
It's good there are samples provided! Less work for me to get a test off the ground.

#### f4464c0
For a moment I hesitated how to make the filenames accessible to the outside of the core functionality. But that was because I tried to come up with function signatures before doing a proper slicing.

#### 4c09991
Finally I remember to do real slices. The dialogs and interactions are obvious so I jump right to the message handling.

While drawing the output for `encrypt` I realize that passing out the number of processed files should be easier and looks natural. The filenames are delivered through a stream as "expected" earlier when I wrote up the signatures.

But the signatures have to be adapted to the slice now: an `int` is returned by the functions.

## Design
I decide that I want to design and implement incrementally because:

* encrypt and decrypt look very similar/symmetric, i.e. if I get one right the other one will be very easy
* I want to move more quickly through all phases to get feedback more quickly

### Increment 1: Encrypt
#### 22f4bdb
I'm hesitating a moment whether to start designing with text or graphics.

I also realize some anxiousness because I'm being watched by the auto-committer and the screen snapper. I want to do it right the first time... :-/

#### 5bdf4e9
First writing down steps that come to my mind as bullet points instead of as a data flow is easier. It's less fixed, less effort.

#### 52b588b
The problem is simple so I come up with the steps in the right order right away.

Numbering the steps is almost not necessary. But I want to use shortcuts during visual refinement.

#### 6267809
I'm not absolutely sure that letting the filename stream flow out of the delete step is the best thing to do. Maybe I'm gonna push the loop up one level and do encryption and deletion both on single filenames.

Counting at the end in the âˆ‘ step seems to be ok. It's so easy.

#### 61fe78d
A lot of work is done in the `FileSystemProvider`. But that's easy, I guess. Good abstractions provided by the .NET Fx.

The core domain logic is nicely sitting in just one functional unit. That will be easy to test.
